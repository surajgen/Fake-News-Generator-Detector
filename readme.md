# Fake News Generator and Detector

This project implements two main functionalities using pretrained Transformer models:

- âœ… A **Fake News Generator** using **GPT-2**
- âœ… A **Fake News Detector** using **DistilBERT**
- âœ… A simple **Gradio User Interface** to interact with both modules

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- **GPT-2**: For generating news-like fake text based on a seed prompt.
- **DistilBERT** (fine-tuned): For binary classification of input text as "FAKE" or "REAL".
